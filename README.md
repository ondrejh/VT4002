VT4002
======

Python program to control Votsch VT 4002 Thermal Chamber over a serial port.

More details about the VT 4002 EMC is available here:
http://www.v-it.com/en/products/temperature_and_climate_test_chambers/schunk01.c.59549.en?_pid=52043

The software supplied along with the Thermal Chamber works only in Windows.
This was an attempt to create a GNU/Linux solution and Python was the most 
logical choice to achieve it.

Please refer the spec (VT4002_climate_chamber.pdf) if you want to know 
more about it.
